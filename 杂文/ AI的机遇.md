## 5 opportunities that will create more millionaires than anything before.

Now Andrew Ng revealed 5 opportunities that will create more millionaires than anything before.

### 1/ Agentic AI beats scaling models

The agentic AI market explodes from $5.1B to $69B by 2032. That's 13x growth in 7 years. Meanwhile, everyone's chasing bigger models that cost billions.

Ng proved something revolutionary:

His 4 design patterns change everything:

• Reflection (AI critiques itself)
• Tool use (connects to APIs)
• Planning (breaks complex tasks)
• Multi-agent collaboration

JPMorgan already cut costs 30% using this.

### 2/ Military AI is the next gold rush

February 2025, Ng stunned Silicon Valley:

"I'm glad Google changed its stance on AI weapons."

His portfolio companies are already saving lives with autonomous drones.

### 3/ AGI is decades away

How do you know if he have AGI? Ng's test is simple:

"Until companies fire ALL intellectual workers, AGI hasn't arrived."

His companies focus on boring, profitable problems.

### 4/ China will dominate through open-source

"There's now a path for China to surpass the U.S. in AI."

Not through bigger models. Through speed.

Smart founders are already leveraging Chinese open models at 1/10th the cost.

### 5/ Small specialized models beat giants

The SLM market grows from $930M to $5.45B by 2032.

Why? Token prices crashed 90%. Edge computing is exploding.

Edge computing spending will hit $378B by 2028.

The shift is happening NOW.
